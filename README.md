# OxiCalc

A small calculator made with rust and gtk4/adwaita, mainly to learn how to use gtk and rust together.
This is a rewrite of a previous calculator -> [calculator with gtk4 and c++](https://github.com/DashieTM/calculator)

This calculator might still have some bugs, feel free to open an issue, so I can go fix it : P
